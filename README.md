# Chester

Adaptation of [csutter/chester-atom-syntax](https://github.com/csutter/chester-atom-syntax) for my very personal taste.

---

A syntax highlighting theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/), with colors based on Lonely Planet's [Rizzo](https://github.com/lonelyplanet/rizzo) styles. Looks quite nice.
